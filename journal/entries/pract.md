I rated myself as a B in SVG. I gave myself this score because I understand what they're used for but not exactly sure how to write the code. To practice I read both the Edube and W3schools pages on SVG and then wrote a basic HTML code using the W3Schoolâ€™s examples. I now understand that the SVg uses similar syntax as Canvas but it is also for Logos and brand marketing. I feel more confident now in SVG. My new rating is an A.

I rated myself a C with Entities. I gave myself this score because I remember reading about it but I never  actually got to use it. The reading I did was the W3Schools HTML Character Entities page. Then for my practice I made a page pretty much just writing some examples of them in a paragraph. Now after having done some practice I would give myself a B which I think is much better. I feel more prepared for this aspect of the test now.
