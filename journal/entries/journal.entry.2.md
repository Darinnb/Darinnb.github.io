# this is my second journal entry

on oct 7, 2024 I was in English class. In english class we transaltes the opening sonnet of Romeo and Juliet into simpler terms. We also wrote 3 lines of iambic penameter. It was very intresting and I really like that class because im always entertained.

## this is a table of Romeo +/and Juliet characters
|Name |Role |
| -------- | ------- |
| Romeo | male lead role, Juliets lover |
| juliet | Lead female role, Romoe's lover |
| Capulet | patriarch of the House of Capulet |
| Mercutio| loyal best friend of Romeo to the death. |
hope fully the table gave you a little bit of understanding of some characters
