# this is my second journal entry

on oct 7, 2024 I was in English class. In english class we transaltes the opening sonnet of Romeo and Juliet into simpler terms. We also wrote 3 lines of iambic penameter. It was very intresting and I really like that class because im always entertained.

## this is a table of Romeo +/and Juliet characters
| Name | Role |
| ------- | ------ |
| Romeo | Male lead role, Juliets lover |
| Juliet | Lead female role, Romoe's lover |
| Capulet | Patriarch of the House of Capulet |
| Mercutio| Loyal best friend of Romeo to the death. |

hopefully the table gave you a little bit of understanding of some characters
