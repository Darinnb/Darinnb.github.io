# Website Research

My first website I researched was Airbnb.com. I was looking for prices and how they listed it. For one of the houses it was $300 a night but when you added in the fact that it was a two night minimum, There was a $250 cleaning fee and a $100 services fee the price quickly escalated. This experience showed me how to scam people in a professional way.

The next website I visited was trivago.com. The home page gave me information about the average hotel prices on different locations and months of the year. According to the website August is when  the most expensive hotel bookings are in Las Vegas. So If I wanted to set up my company there I would sell my tickets in August because that is where there is the most demand.

The final website I visited was SpaceX.com. I wanted to see how they presented their manned trips. On the homepage of the Human Spaceflight section. They had videos of astronauts looking at the earth from the dragon capsule and much else. The whole website had dark, rich colors and it was mostly pictures and diagrams. The SpaceX website helped me figure out the ambiance of my website.
