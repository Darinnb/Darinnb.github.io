# Div 1 entry, game project

I took inspiration from the different types of games Mr. Jones gave us and picked a survival game. The objective of this game is to escape the objects flying at you and not get hit. The score will be how many seconds you survive and what level you're at. The way you lose is my being hit by an object and you donâ€™t really win. It's one of those never ending games but there is a score keeper. The players will use the arrow keys to move around and survive. The features I will be adding to my MVP is the addition of double the objects flying at you every 5  seconds at random times, speeds, and directions(hopefully). So that game is every second double the objects are flying at you and you try to survive as long as possible.
