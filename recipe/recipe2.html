			<p>Chocolate chip cookies are classics but with the right recipe they can become family treasures. Here is a chocolate chip cookie recipe that will bite its way into your heart. When I was a kid I used to bake these with my mom every weekend for dessert. I still have the memories of eating that first soft and sweet treat. As I grew up I made them for my roommates in college when we hosted get togethers. Now I'll make them for my kids' parties and potlucks. Whatever the reason, these cookies are perfect for any event.</p>
