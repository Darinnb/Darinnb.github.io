			<p>My family makes mashed potatoes every year during thanksgiving.<q>I loves to eat them from below the table</q> <cite> My dog. </cite>
 Mashed potatoes are my favorite part of Thanksgiving dinner. Everyone in my family eats the mashed potatoes but if it weren't for myself we wouldn't make them.I love the creaminess of the dish, it always reminds me of time with my family.  Thanksgiving is one of my favorites if not my favorite holiday. I get to see family I haven't seen in a while and we go to D.C and walk around. I like this time because I get to relax from school and just hang out with my family. In all, mashed potatoes remind me of special times with loved ones. </p>
	<h2>Tips</h2>
<ul>
<li>
making sure to get all the moisture out is very important for the texture of the dish.
</li>
<li>
My family loves to put Penzy's spices on our mashed potatoes. Good seasoning can make the dish!
</li>
<li>
If you are putting gravy on your mashed potatoes we recommend a medium sized drizzle to not drown it.
