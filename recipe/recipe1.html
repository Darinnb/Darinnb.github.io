		<h2> Background </h2>
			<p>My family makes mashed potatoes every year during thanksgiving. Mashed potatoes are my favorite part of Thanksgiving dinner. Everyone in my family eats the mashed potatoes but if it weren't for myself we wouldn't make them.I love the creaminess of the dish, it always reminds me of time with my family.  Thanksgiving is one of my favorites if not my favorite holiday. I get to see family I haven't seen in a while and we go to D.C and walk around. I like this time because I get to relax from school and just hang out with my family. In all, mashed potatoes remind me of special times with loved ones. </p>
